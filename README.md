![Dashboard Example](example.png)

## Objective
Analyze the residential rental market in Rio de Janeiro, identifying factors that influence prices and generating insights for investors, landlords, and tenants.

## 1. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
- Missing values handled: 'expenses' (condo fee) filled with 0, rows without 'price' removed.
- Price outliers identified using boxplot and IQR.

## 2. Key Insights

### Price Distribution
- Most properties have prices concentrated in lower ranges, but there are outliers (luxury properties).
- Histogram and boxplot show strong skewness.

#### Example charts generated:
![Top 5 most expensive neighborhoods](figures/top5_expensive.png)
![Top 5 cheapest neighborhoods](figures/top5_cheap.png)
![Bedrooms vs price](figures/rooms_vs_price.png)
![Pet-friendly proportion](figures/pet_friendly.png)
![Furnished proportion](figures/furnished.png)

### Most Expensive and Cheapest Neighborhoods

  - (Example: Leblon, Ipanema, Barra da Tijuca, Copacabana, Jardim BotÃ¢nico)
- **Top 5 cheapest:**
  - (Example: Bangu, Campo Grande, Realengo, Santa Cruz, Pavuna)
- Bar charts illustrate the difference in average prices.

### Bedrooms/Bathrooms and Price Relationship
- Properties with more bedrooms tend to have higher prices.

### Pet-Friendly and Furnished Properties

## 3. Factors Influencing Price
- Location (neighborhood) is the main factor.
